				    <h2>Did you say Lumad?</h2>
                    <h4>an essay by Beatriz Dijamco</h4>
					<p>Stop Lumad killings? It’s just a tribal war making heavy use of rabble-rousers all for fun and entertainment! The life of the Lumad is so easy and privileged and yet, they remain attention-seekers. They have staged lightning rallies, organized walkathons called “Walk with the Lumad,” and camped out at Liwasang Bonifacio and in Quezon City in the last five years. The Lumad kids? Oh, they are these entitled kids who demand from the government to make education accessible to them. Imagine, they have the audacity to make their own Twitter account @SaveLumadSchool and even have this hashtag campaign #SaveLumadSchools and #StandWithBakwitSchools.</p>
                    <p>Being one of the major groups of Philippine Indigenous Peoples, the Lumad seem to think they have the sole ancestral rights to the lands in Mindanao. How cruel! When will they realize that mining corporations are better in armed manpower and resources to exploit, err I mean, to oversee and enrich the lands and other resources in southern Philippines? It seems they never learn. The only practical and viable solution is simply to deport this group far away from Mindanao, the Land of Promise and Potential.</p>

                    <p>Should that solution fail, maybe it is high time that we educate ourselves on what their plight is. More than the political, let us find the human side of what they are voicing out. Let us think critically and compassionately about the young children whose right to education is trampled on and who in their young lives have witnessed violence and discrimination. Let us make use of both social and mainstream media to encourage people to know and respond to the struggles the Lumad continue to face. A sustained coverage should be made available not just sporadic news about them. Lastly, actual proper representation in our society must be given to them in areas of health, education, infrastructure, and political among others. </p>
                    <p>Not to romanticise resiliency of the Filipino people, but amidst the challenges, backlash and lack of support, the Lumad stay true to what they are fighting for, which is resiliency at its finest. Yes, the Lumad is a Filipino just like us.</p>

                            <h3>What are the Lumads fighting for?</h3>
                            <p>In Mindanao, the Lumad tribes face a multitude of challenges, including defending what is legally theirs from the corporate interests of mining companies. </p>
                            <p>Their situation has only become more difficult with the implementation of martial law in Mindanao.</p>
                            <p>The Lumads continue to fight for their rights, amid these obstacles, all in the name of living in harmony on their own land.</p>
